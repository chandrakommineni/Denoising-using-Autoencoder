Denoising Autoencoders are a class of autoencoders where we attempt to remove noise from a customized data. Note the emphasis on the word `customized`. Given that we train a DAE on a particular dataset, it is optimized to remove dataset from the samples of that dataset only and will not be suitable on other dataset samples.
